This project was funded by agreements by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to Roger Williams University (RWU) 
in partnership with the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program. Although the information in this document has been funded 
wholly or in part by EPA under the agreements CE00A00967 to RWU, it has not undergone the Agencyâ€™s publications review 
process and therefore, may not necessarily reflect the views of the Agency and no official endorsement should be 
inferred. The viewpoints expressed here do not necessarily represent those of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, 
RWU, or EPA nor does mention of trade names, commercial products, or causes constitute endorsement or recommendation 
for use.
